### Pytorch clean code 

An advice given to me by a PhD student studying at CMU with regards to being a good deep learning research is to first be able to learn how to write good code in deep learning

Important aspects for clean code
1. Reproducibility 

This is a repository documenting clean code guidelines for developing pytorch models

Links to repository with clean code:
- Pytorch documentation: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html
- Pytorch template: https://github.com/victoresque/pytorch-template  

#### Building datasets
